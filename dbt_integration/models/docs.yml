    description: The 'myModel' is a dbt model that processes stock market data. It
      starts by staging the data from the 'stg_stockMarket' table in the
      'dbt_dataset' dataset of the 'stockmarketrealtimedataanalysi' project. The
      model partitions the data by 'Date' and 'Index' and orders it by 'Date'.
      It then deduplicates the data by selecting the first row of each
      partition. The model finally selects all columns from the deduplicated
      data, concatenates 'Date' and 'Index' to create a unique 'id', and orders
      the data by this 'id'. The output of this model is a table with columns
      'id', 'CloseUSD', 'Adj_Close', 'Close', 'Open', 'Low', 'Volume', 'High',
      'Date', and 'Index'.
